            <p>Here you can find some of the UK-based technical speakers and leading experts on emerging technologies and trends from Microsoft and our MVP community. We offer expert presentations on a wide range of topics and speak at meetups, conferences and community events.</p>
            <p>We try and make ourselves available where possible but sometimes geography, logistics and diaries work against us so it is best if you contact speakers who are geographically near to you initially.</p>
